## Brief Summary

This mixed reality artwork explores the balance between **utopia and dystopia** through immersive technology. The dystopian world represents modern society's overwhelming technological chaos, while the utopian world embodies inner peace and tranquility from individual mental states. The artwork visualizes how external chaos disrupts our inner harmony.

Built on **Unity** and deployed on **Meta Quest 3**, the experience creates a virtual cyberpunk Japan street representing dystopia, overlaid onto physical space. Flying origami cranes carrying oracle poems serve as symbols of hope, guiding audiences toward utopia. The system generates emotional oracle poems through **large language models** in real-time, with each crane sealed in corresponding emotional colors.

Through **gesture interactions**, audiences can point at origami cranes to engage with the virtual environment. When players interact with the cranes, they experience emotion contagion through a sequence of color history, creating locative memories that connect all visitors to the space. Additionally, each crane now carries emotion-related stories; when players click on them, corresponding emotional images are revealed, enhancing the immersive narrative experience.

This interactive system allows audiences to perceive how external influences affect their mental states while providing tools for adjustment. The artwork aims to raise awareness about retrieving balance under reality's pressures and encourages reexamination of social identity and role conflicts. By visualizing individuals' inner worlds, the piece creates a bridge between physical and mental spaces, fostering reflection on our relationship with technology and society.

## Production Methods

This project was developed on the foundation of **Unity** using the **Meta XR Plugin**, which provided the core framework for building the interactive environment.

For real-time content generation, we integrated two external AI tools:

* **ChatGPT API:** Used to generate fortune texts with different emotional tones in real-time as users interact with the system.
* **ComfyUI API:** Served as the real-time image generation tool, converting text outputs into prompts.

By using these tools together, we created a program that dynamically links emotions, fortune texts, and images in real-time, presenting the generated images as the main interface for the user.
